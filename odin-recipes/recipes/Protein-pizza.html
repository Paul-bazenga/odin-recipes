        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Make the dough</li>
        <p>If you don't have self-rising flour, make your own by combining flour with baking powder 
           and salt in a large bowl. Add greek yogurt and additional salt to flour and stir to combine
            until a dough starts to form. If the dough is too thick, add more yogurt, 1 Tablespoon at a time. 
            If the dough is too thin, add a sprinkle of more flour.
        </p>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Shape the dough</li>
        <p>
         Use your hands to shape the dough into a smooth ball until all the dry flour is gone.
         This should take about 2-3 minutes.
        </p>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Roll the dough</li>
        <p>
            Cover the dough ball completely in flour (this will prevent it from sticking to the counter or roller). 
            Transfer the dough ball to a floured surface. Roll out the dough into a circle or rectangle shape using 
            a rolling pin or smooth bottle, until about ¼ inch thick.
        </p>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Add toppings:</li>
        <p>
            Using your hands or a spatula, carefully transfer the dough to a lightly floured baking dish or pizza stone. 
            Add sauce and spread over dough evenly, leaving at least ¼ inch space around the edges. Sprinkle on cooked
             ground chicken or turkey sausage, onion and red bell pepper evenly over pizza crust. Top with mozzarella cheese.
        </p>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Bake</li>
        <p>
            Bake pizza for about 20 minutes at 400°F until cheese is browned and bubbly and crust
            is golden brown, rotating pan once halfway through. Remove from the oven, let cool for a few 
            minutes and enjoy!
